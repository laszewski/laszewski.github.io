abstract: The Comet petascale supercomputer was put into production as an XSEDE resource
  in early 2015 with the goal of serving a much larger user community than HPC systems
  of similar size. The Comet project set an audacious goal of reaching over 10 and
  000 users in its four years of planned operation. That goal was achieved in less
  than two years and due in large part to the adoption of policies that favor smaller
  allocations and science gateways. Here we describe our experiences in operating
  and supporting Comet and highlight some of the important science that it has enabled
  and and provide some practical lessons that we have learned by operating a system
  designed for the long tail of science.
