Be part of a team to create a multicloud access to a service offered
by multiple cloud or cloud service providers.

Your goal will be to develop an API, secure REST, and command line
tool that easily interfaces with a service framework or tool offered by multiple
cloud providers.  Your integrated service will utilize all or one
of them to achieve a task related to an analysis conducted by X.

This is especially useful for data scientists that may want to access
multiple cloud providers and eliminate vendor lock-in or to access
services that other providers do not offer.

## Deliverables

You will be developing

1. A comparison of X on various cloud or cloud service providers.
   Distinguish them by chracteroistics, create a table
   
1. A command line interface to the service
2. A Rest API that calls out other services
3. A Python API that wraps several services into a convenient library
5. A manual describing the functionality


4. Put everything in a container so it can be run on Linux, Mac and
   Windows.
5. Create a convenient command line tool that allows starting the service, interacting with it, and making this easy to use. The command line will hide the docker commands while providing human
   readable abbreviations.
6. Deliver unit tests with pytests
6. Deliver a high-quality report including benchmarks
7. Integrate authentication to the cloud providers and to the REST service.
8. Use Yaml for the configuration of the service
9. Do the development in a container using 20.04. We will create a DOckerfile
10. The code will be developed in GitHub at cloudmesh, which will be set up by Gregor


## Requirements

In order for you to participate in this project, you will need:

1. A computer on which you can run docker (Windows Home will not work)
2. Significant python knowledge
3. Be highly motivated
4. Be willing to have meetings on this project once or twice a week
5. Showcase significant progress over the lifetime of the project.
6. Be knowledgeable with GitHub (a repository will be provided to which
   Dr. von Laszewski will contribute)
7. Conduct task management in GitHub (Gregor will explain)
8. Be honest and not hiding problems or implementation bugs.
9. You must be able to do a videoconference and be able to share your screen (I typically use google meet or zoom).

## Getting started

1. start with a Survey
2. design the command line interface first as that may be the easiest and will showcase how to design the API
