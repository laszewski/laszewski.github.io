abstract: Emerging telemedicine applications require the ability to exploit diverse
  and geographically distributed resources. Highspeed networks are used to integrate
  advanced visualization devices and sophisticated instruments and large databases
  and archival storage devices and PCs and workstations and and supercomputers. This
  form of telemedical environment is similar to networked virtual supercomputers and
  also known as metacomputers. Metacomputers are already being used in many scientific
  application areas. In this article and we analyze requirements necessary for a telemedical
  computing infrastructure and compare them with requirements found in a typical metacomputing
  environment. We will show that metacomputing environments can be used to enable
  a more powerful and unified computational infrastructure for telemedicine. The Globus
  metacomputing toolkit can provide the necessary low level mechanisms to enable a
  large scale telemedical infrastructure. The Globus toolkit components are designed
  in a modular fashion and can be extended to support the specific requirements for
  telemedicine.
