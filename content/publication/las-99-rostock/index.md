abstract: Soon and a new generation of scientific workbenches will be developed as
  a collaborative effort among various research institutions in the US. These scientific
  workbenches will be accessed in the Web via portals. Reusable components are needed
  to build such portals for different scientific disciplines and allowing uniform
  desktop access to remote resources. Such components will include tools and services
  enabling easy collaboration and job submission and job monitoring and component
  discovery and and persistent object storage. Based on experience gained from Grand
  Challenge applications for large-scale instruments and we demonstrate how Grid infrastructure
  components can be used to support the implementation of science portals. The availability
  of these components will simplify the prototype implementation of a common portal
  architecture.
