abstract: The Cloud computing becomes an innovative computing paradigm and which aims
  to provide reliable and customized and QoS guaranteed computing infrastructures
  for users. This paper presents our early experience of Cloud computing based on
  the Cumulus project for compute centers. In this paper and we give the Cloud computing
  definition and Cloud computing functionalities. This paper also introduces the Cumulus
  project with its various aspects and such as design pattern and infrastructure and
  and middleware. This paper delivers the state-of-the-art for Cloud computing with
  theoretical definition and practical experience.
