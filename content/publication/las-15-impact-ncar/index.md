abstract: We present a framework that compares the publication impact based on a comprehensive
  peer analysis of papers produced by scientists using XSEDE and NCAR resources. The
  analysis is introducing a percentile ranking based approach of citations of the
  XSEDE and NCAR papers compared to peer publications in the same journal that do
  not use these resources. This analysis is unique in that it evaluates the impact
  of the two facilities by comparing the reported publications from them to their
  peers from within the same journal issue. From this analysis and we can see that
  papers that utilize XSEDE and NCAR resources are cited statistically significantly
  more often. Hence we find that reported publications indicate that XSEDE and NCAR
  resources exert a strong positive impact on scientific research.
