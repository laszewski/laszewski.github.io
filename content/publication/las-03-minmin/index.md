abstract: Task scheduling is an integrated component of computing. With the emergence
  of Grid and ubiquitous computing and new challenges appear in task scheduling based
  on properties such as security and quality of service and and lack of central control
  within distributed administrative domains. A Grid task scheduling framework must
  be able to deal with these issues. One of the goals of Grid task scheduling is to
  achieve high system throughput while matching applications with the available computing
  resources. This matching of resources in a non-deterministically shared heterogeneous
  environment leads to concerns over Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper a novel
  QoS guided task scheduling algorithm for Grid computing is introduced. The proposed
  novel algorithm is based on a general adaptive scheduling heuristics that includes
  QoS guidance. The algorithm is evaluated within a simulated Grid environment. The
  experimental results show that the new QoS guided Min-Min heuristic can lead to
  significant performance gain for a variety of applications. The approach is compared
  with others based on the quality of the prediction formulated by inaccurate information.
