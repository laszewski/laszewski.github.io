abstract: The Collaboratory for Multi-scale Chemical Science (CMCS) is developing
  a powerful informatics-based approach to synthesizing multi-scale information in
  support of systems-based research and is applying it within combustion science.
  An open source multi-scale informatics toolkit is being developed that addresses
  a number of issues core to the emerging concept of knowledge grids including provenance
  tracking and lightweight federation of data and application resources into cross-scale
  information flows. The CMCS portal is currently in use by a number of high-profile
  pilot groups and is playing a significant role in enabling their efforts to improve
  and extend community maintained chemical reference information.
