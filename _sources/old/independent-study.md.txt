# Projects 


Each semesters I typicality supervise a **LIMITED** number of students
conducting independent studies in cloud computing. Projects are based on
my needs and the students background skills and interests (with
difficulty level in brackets):

1.  *(minimum moderate project)* Define your own project that lays
    within my and your interest
2.  *(moderate)* improve the JavaScript GUI from cloudmesh (github
    cloudmesh
3.  *(moderate)* develop a python interface for cloudmesh for tashi (a
    command line based cloud interface) via a proxy service
4.  *(moderate)* conduct code cleanup and documentation for cloudmesh
5.  *(moderate)* switch the cloudmesh framework from flask to dajango
6.  *(difficult)* develop a scheduler based on load, energy, and temperature
    for openstack and conduct performance experiments with different
    schedulers
7.  *(extremely difficult, and requires knowledge of security)* develop
    better security certificate management for MS Azure python library
8.  *(difficult)* develop an analysis of 140K+ literature data to
    prepare a social network graph and conduct significant statistical
    analysis of the data.

The time requirement for a 3 hour independent study is about 12-15 hours
per week like a regular class. If time is missed in one week, I strongly
recommend to work extra hard the next week. Typically, students
underestimate the work it takes for an independent study or just say its
just an independent study so i can just ignore it. However, you only get
as much out of the independent study as you put in.

Prerequisites to be met **BEFORE** you start with difficulty level
(trivial, moderate, difficult):

1.  (easy) git
2.  (trivial) python
3.  REST (either (trivial) flask, (moderate) django, (trivial) cherypy,
    other rest frameworks dependent on project)
4.  (moderate) possibly javascript jquery, depends on project (in case
    of project (g) additionally a graph based data base such as
    (moderate) neo4j or similar and strong knowledge on how to access it
    from python)
5.  (trivial) no more than 9 credit hours total (including the 3 credit
    hours for the independent study) in the last semester before
    graduating (practical experience shows that students are not able to
    handle more). Ideally you would have less.
6.  (trivial) communication which other classes you will take so I can
    judge if an independent study is even possible (I want to avoid you
    overload yourself)
7.  (difficult to admit for some) be aware that an independent study is
    fun but requires work equivalent to some of your most demanding
    classes at the university.

Other things I expect:

1.  (trivial) come to the lab so interaction is easier (Innovation
    Center at 10th and bypass

## Reporting Requirements


1.  (trivial) weekly “meaningful” bullet point report answering the
    questions, typically due on Friday, noon:
    1.  how many hours have I worked this week? In case I did not how
        will I catch up including concrete plans.
    2.  what have I achieved this week?
    3.  what have I not achieved this week and how will I overcome it?
    4.  what will I achieve next week?
2.  (trivial) Minimal Meetings: one personal meeting per week, with
    option to meet a second time. Be prepared for the meetings so we
    minimize time. Many students opt to meet more frequently with me.
3.  (moderate) Projects (a)-(f) do not require a report, but strong and
    well documented code. (difficult) Project (g) does require a high
    quality report written in English with grammar and spellcheck.
    Graphics are done in a variety of tools including excel charts,
    matlab, R, D3js. The display of results may be very challenging.

<!-- -->

1.  (trivial) Office: You will have an office space with desktop. You
    are welcome to use your own laptop and use a virtual machine to
    conduct your project on it. We have access to 4000K cores, so the
    computer is just a startingpoint to the supercomputers/clouds we
    have.

## Teamwork


Teamwork in an independent study with me is allowed as long as the work
can be clearly distinguished between students and I know that one
student is not doing all the work. If work can not be distingushed an
oral quiz at the end of the semester could solve the issue. However I
have never done this as students tell me what they have done when they
work in teams to get a fair grade. If work is done in a team, work
naturally is more with 2 students and we may pick up two of the projects
above r make a single project more intense. Some students come with
partners to me.
