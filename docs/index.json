This coincides with the pervasive use of networks in a host of disciplines of interest to industry and academia and including biology and neurology and genomics and psychology and social sciences and economics and psychology and and cyber-physical systems and infrastructure. Several dozen journals and conferences regularly contain articles related to networks. Yet and there are no general purpose cyberinfrastructures (CI) that can be used across these varied disciplines and domains. Furthermore and while there are scientific gateways that include some network science capabilities for particular domains (e.g. and biochemistry and genetics) and there are no general-purpose network-based scientific gateways. In this work and we introduce net.science and a CI for Network Engineering and Science and that is designed to be a community resource. This paper provides an overview of net.science and addressing key requirements and concepts and CI components and the types of applications that our CI will support and and various dimensions of our evaluation process.

We have 100-200 Raspberry Pis which provide an ideal playground for building your own cluster and explore distributed computing algorithms on real hardware. In this project you would be building a cluster and than putting cloud software on the cluster to make it our own cloud service.\nSuch software can include but is not limited to\n Docker Kubernetwes Map/Reduce  When chosing this project one must address the issue of dealing with many compute resources at a time. THis can be done with PXE boot or with our cm-burn.\nStudents that chose this project will have an office space in the building that I sit. In addition each student will be given a 5 node cluster thay can work at home on (non smoking environment) that must be returned after the project is completed.\ncm-burn cm-burn is a program to burn many SD cards for the preparation of building clusters with Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s. The program is developed in Python and is portable on Linux, Windows, and OSX. It allows users to create readily bootable SD cards that have the network configured, contain a public ssh key from your machine that you used to configure the cards. The unique feature is that you can burn multiple cards in a row.\nA sample command invocation looks like:\ncm-burn â€”-name red[5-7] \\ --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \\ â€”-ips 192.168.1.[5-7] \\ â€”-image 2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch  This command creates 3 SD cards where the hostnames red5, red6, red 7 with the network addresses 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, and 192.168.1.7. The public key is added to the authorized_keys file of the pi user. The password login is automatically disabled and only the ssh key authentication is enabled.\nReferences   https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm-burn  ","date":1565827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565827200,"objectID":"2762d9c5c5bcbb796aed5fa88b61de6c","permalink":"/project/pi-cloud-cluster/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pi-cloud-cluster/","section":"project","summary":"Raspberry Pi Cloud Cluster THis project is open to anyone wanting to work with me on building a Raspberry Pi Cloud Cluster.

By utilizing publication data from various sources, e.g., ISI Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph, we calculate the impact metrics of XSEDE publications and show how they compare with non-XSEDE publication from the same field of study, or non-organization peers from the same journal issue. To perform this analysis we need to identify the bibliographic dataset and clean and currate them.\nWe then introduce the metrics we used for evaluation and comparison, and the methods used to calculate them. Detailed analysis results of Field Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and the peers comparison will be presented and discussed. We also explain how the same approaches could be used to evaluate publications from a similar organization or institute, to demonstrate the general applicability of the present evaluation approach providing impact on organizations and groups.\nReferences    Evaluating the Scientific Impact of XSEDE Fugang Wang, Gregor von Laszewski, Timothy Whitson, Geoffrey C Fox, Thomas R Furlani, Robert L DeLeon, Steven M Gallo Jan 1, 2018\n   Peer Comparison of XSEDE and NCAR Publication Data G. von Laszewski, F.

The analysis is introducing a percentile ranking based approach of citations of the XSEDE and NCAR papers compared to peer publications in the same journal that do not use these resources. This analysis is unique in that it evaluates the impact of the two facilities by comparing the reported publications from them to their peers from within the same journal issue. From this analysis and we can see that papers that utilize XSEDE and NCAR resources are cited statistically significantly more often.

The cyberinfrastructure consists of the application and middleware and hardware resources. The application core consists of various optimization modules and a simulation module. This paper focuses on the development of specific middleware components of the cyberinfrastructure that enables efficient seamless execution of the application core in a grid environment. The components developed in this research include: (i) a coarse-grained parallel wrapper for the simulation module that includes additional features for persistent execution and (ii) a seamless job submission interface and and (iii) a graphical real time application monitoring tool. The performance of the cyberinfrastructure is evaluated on a local cluster and the TeraGrid.","tags":[],"title":"Cyberinfrastructure for Contamination Source Characterization in Water Distribution Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Mihael Hategan","Depti Kodeboyina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550574,"objectID":"7e30e8defb4e59144d89a238a4176dca","permalink":"/publication/las-06-workflow-book/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:14.200373Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-06-workflow-book/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Grid Workflow with the Java CoG Kit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Kaplan","Geoffrey C.

Lowering the barrier of entry for access to these codes is often a technical and sociological challenge. Portals help bridge the gap because they are well known interfaces enabling access to a large variety of resources, services, applications, and tools for private, public, and commercial entities, while hiding the complexities of the underlying software systems to the user. This paper presents an overview of the current state-of-the-art in grid portals, based on a component approach that utilizes portlet frameworks and the most recent Grid standards, the Web Services Resource Framework and a summary of current DOE portal efforts.","tags":[],"title":"Grid portal architectures for scientific applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Mike Hategan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550572,"objectID":"08ea9a75d98cd2a6d316b42b4f04494e","permalink":"/publication/las-05-gridworkflow/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:12.500198Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-05-gridworkflow/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Grid Workflow -- An Integrated Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Mike Hategan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550572,"objectID":"687943834d1fb1f37ad82a4498286ee3","permalink":"/publication/las-05-gridandt-user/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:12.289835Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-05-gridandt-user/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Java cog kit karajan/gridant workflow guide","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Omer Rana","Asif Akram","Rashid Al-Ali","David Walker","Gregor von Laszewski","Kaizar Amin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550572,"objectID":"df93150398f0c4a4915a190ed8c54e6f","permalink":"/publication/las-05-qos-book/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:12.819578Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-05-qos-book/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Quality-of-Service Based Grid Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550573,"objectID":"2ccf1a2a8fe4424aab2e3e14d676622f","permalink":"/publication/las-05-workflow-jgc/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:13.245102Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-05-workflow-jgc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Workflow Concepts of the Java CoG Kit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rashid Al-Ali","Kaizar Amin","von Laszewski"," Gregor","Omer Rana","David Walker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1101859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550569,"objectID":"c30812307d68525ba6f13ffa68e1d154","permalink":"/publication/las-03-qos/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:09.847508Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-03-qos/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An OGSA-based Quality of Service Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaizar Amin","Gregor von Laszewski","Armin R.

With the emergence of Grid and ubiquitous computing and new challenges appear in task scheduling based on properties such as security and quality of service and and lack of central control within distributed administrative domains. A Grid task scheduling framework must be able to deal with these issues. One of the goals of Grid task scheduling is to achieve high system throughput while matching applications with the available computing resources. This matching of resources in a non-deterministically shared heterogeneous environment leads to concerns over Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper a novel QoS guided task scheduling algorithm for Grid computing is introduced. The proposed novel algorithm is based on a general adaptive scheduling heuristics that includes QoS guidance. The algorithm is evaluated within a simulated Grid environment. The experimental results show that the new QoS guided Min-Min heuristic can lead to significant performance gain for a variety of applications. The approach is compared with others based on the quality of the prediction formulated by inaccurate information.","tags":[],"title":"QoS guided Min-Min heuristic for grid task scheduling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Mei-Hui Su","Joseph Insley","Ian Foster","Carl Kesselman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550568,"objectID":"4ac38a9b69cf5a1a90eb8d696e741f50","permalink":"/publication/las-03-cmt-book/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:08.889627Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-03-cmt-book/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sourcebook of Parallel Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.-H.

Such components will include tools and services enabling easy collaboration and job submission and job monitoring and component discovery and and persistent object storage. Based on experience gained from Grand Challenge applications for large-scale instruments and we demonstrate how Grid infrastructure components can be used to support the implementation of science portals.

This form of telemedical environment is similar to networked virtual supercomputers and also known as metacomputers. Metacomputers are already being used in many scientific application areas. In this article and we analyze requirements necessary for a telemedical computing infrastructure and compare them with requirements found in a typical metacomputing environment. We will show that metacomputing environments can be used to enable a more powerful and unified computational infrastructure for telemedicine. The Globus metacomputing toolkit can provide the necessary low level mechanisms to enable a large scale telemedical infrastructure. The Globus toolkit components are designed in a modular fashion and can be extended to support the specific requirements for telemedicine.","tags":["\"Globus toolkit and Telemedicine and Metacomputing\""],"title":"A Computational Framework for Telemedicine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Ian Foster"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":883612800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550584,"objectID":"53d48f2a0fa0cba197dc6becf3a99f65","permalink":"/publication/las-98-ldap/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:24.305862Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-98-ldap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Usage of LDAP in Globus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Mary L.

In order to achieve a valid climate forecast, an accurate initial condition is needed to apply the governing equations describing the model. Data analysis techniques are able to derive this initial state from irregular distributed observations. This thesis provides a parallel algorithm for the data analysis. Algorithms using static and dynamic decomposition are introduced and their performance is analyzed. A decomposition with linear speedup is presented.During the parallelization many different computers and programming paradigms have been utilized. In order to simplify the access for the user and developer a metacomputing environment has been developed. The meta-computing environment allows one to generate message passing parallel programs from a visual representation of a task graph. Besides the creation of stand-alone parallel programs, the task graph can be transferred into separate jobs executed on different supercomputers. Messages between the jobs are exchanged with the help of files. The underlying concept for this metacomputing environment is a dynamical dataflow model allowing multi-paradigm programming. A dynamical task scheduling algorithm determines on which component of the metacomputer a task is scheduled and which algorithm performs the task. The execution of the program is visually animated.","tags":[],"title":"A Parallel Data Assimilation System and Its Implications on a Metacomputing Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":788918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550583,"objectID":"5d8b10496785e348c5cd6e60b211fc86","permalink":"/publication/las-95-issues-parallel/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:23.455932Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-95-issues-parallel/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Issues in Parallel Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":788918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550583,"objectID":"d5c92260d9f99cb4cd833aa3d51b2cfc","permalink":"/publication/las-95-infomall/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:23.349388Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-95-infomall/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Minimal Requirements for a Graphical User Interface for InfoMall Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":788918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550583,"objectID":"ce0e800ebecb809aebde329821d6f0c9","permalink":"/publication/las-95-mopac/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:23.562292Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-95-mopac/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Parallelization of MOPAC","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":788918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550583,"objectID":"8095c42a908102325b7c970420f0071d","permalink":"/publication/las-95-xpvm/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:23.668057Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-95-xpvm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"XPVM: An X window based interface to the PVM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Mike Seablom","Milo Makivic","Peter Lyster","Sanya Ranka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":783648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550583,"objectID":"6f0c24262568c99ba3ee7e6d288dbb1a","permalink":"/publication/las-94-ecwmf/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:23.243039Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-94-ecwmf/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Design Issues for the Parallelization of an Optimal Interpolation Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":725846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550588,"objectID":"31fd155fe881173ef94b80836eeecb41","permalink":"/publication/von-1993-collection/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:27.923049Z","relpermalink":"/publication/von-1993-collection/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A collection of graph partitioning algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":[" Mohamed","A Gaber","Geoffrey C Fox","Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":725846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550586,"objectID":"17b72d205a1344839cce280187d14449","permalink":"/publication/lu-93-journal/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:26.856327Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lu-93-journal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Blocked LU factorization on a multiprocessor computer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Von Laszewski"," Gregor"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":725846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629550588,"objectID":"232bd7801eeec022f26a1750599a24eb","permalink":"/publication/von-1993-parallelization/","publishdate":"2021-08-21T12:56:28.030394Z","relpermalink":"/publication/von-1993-parallelization/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Parallelization of a Weather Prediction Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.
