The unique feature is that you can burn multiple cards in a row.\nA sample command invocation looks like:\ncm-burn —-name red[5-7] \\ --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \\ —-ips 192.168.1.[5-7] \\ —-image 2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch  This command creates 3 SD cards where the hostnames red5, red6, red 7 with the network addresses 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, and 192.168.1.7.

To perform this analysis we need to identify the bibliographic dataset and clean and currate them.\nWe then introduce the metrics we used for evaluation and comparison, and the methods used to calculate them.

The analysis is introducing a percentile ranking based approach of citations of the XSEDE and NCAR papers compared to peer publications in the same journal that do not use these resources. This analysis is unique in that it evaluates the impact of the two facilities by comparing the reported publications from them to their peers from within the same journal issue. From this analysis, we can see that papers that utilize XSEDE and NCAR resources are cited statistically significantly more often. Hence we find that reported publications indicate that XSEDE and NCAR resources exert a strong positive impact on scientific research.","tags":["\"Resource management\"","\"Data analysis\"","\"Ranking (statistics)\"","\"Atmospheric measurements\"","\"Extraterrestrial measurements\"","\"Conferences\"","\"Metrics\"","\"publications\""],"title":"Peer Comparison of XSEDE and NCAR Publication Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Fugang Wang","Geoffrey C.
