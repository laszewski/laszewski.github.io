   * - Project
     - Description
   * - NIST
     - In this project we develop language independent service
       specification useful for the creation of Big Data Architectures. The
       result are published as part of a NIST Big Data Reference
       Architecture.
   * - Cloudmesh
     - In this research project we are developing the concepts and to
       develop services and clients for multihosted and hybrid clouds.
   * - Virtual Clusters
     - In this project we are developing the mechanisms to stage virtual
       clusters on one of the biggest educational research computers in the
       nation. THis work is collaboratively done with San Diego Super
       Computer Center.
   * - Scientific Impact Metrics
     - In this project we are evaluating organizations based on bibliometric
       data while using our unique metric. We have applied this metric to
       the largest educational HPC compute resources in the US and provide
       monthly updates that are reported to NSF.
   * - Cloud and Edge Computing
     - In this project we develop services and practical applications to
       combine Cloud and Edge Computing. At this time we try to build and
       interface with an environmental robot boat that conducts in future
       its analysis in the cloud and HPC compute resources
   * - STEM FLL Robotics
     - I am coaching a team of STEM students that has won the special
       judges project award in the World championship. If you are
       interested in finding out more contact me. The project is also continued
       as part of my cloud projects.
