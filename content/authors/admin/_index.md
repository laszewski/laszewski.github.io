* [Curriculumn Vitae (CV)](vonLaszewski-resume.pdf) including links to most papers.
At the University of Virginia, he is a Research Professor at the Biocomplexity Institute. 
His current interests include
    Multicloud Hybrid Cloud Computing Analytics Services,
    MLCommons Benchmarking of Deep Learning Applications,
    Workflow Management for Benchmarking of DeepLearning Algorithms, and 
    Student Research Project Supervision.
He initiated the
[Cloudmesh project](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/)
which hybrid multicloud toolkit to enable cloud computing across
various Cloud and Container IaaS such as OpenStack, AWS, Azure,
docker, docker swarm, and Kubernetes.

He received a Masters Degree in 1990 from the University of Bonn,
Germany, and a Ph.D. in 1996 from Syracuse University in computer
science. He held a position at Argonne National Laboratory from
Nov. 1996 â€“ Aug. 2009, where he was last a scientist and a fellow of
the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago. During his last
two years at ANL he was on sabbatical and an Associate Professor and
the Director of an institution at Rochester Institute of Technology,
focusing on Cyberinfrastructure.

At Indiana University he was an Assistant Director in the Digital Science
Center (DSC) in the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana
University.

Past academic appointments include Adjunct Professor in the
Intelligent Systems Engineering Department at Indiana University, Adjunct Professor positions at the Computer
Science Department at Indiana University, Associate Professor at
Rochester Institute of Technology, Adjunct Professor at the University of
North Texas. He has also taught voluntarily at Illinois
Institute of Technology.

He provided leadership to interface with the San Diego
Supercomputing Center on virtual clusters for XSEDE comet.
He was the co-PI on developing a scientific impact metric for the longest-running high-performance computing infrastructure funded by NSF spanning XSEDE, reaching as far back as TerraGrid.
Previously, he was the architect of FutureGrid, one of the first
successful clouds in US academia. He was previously involved in Grid
computing since the term was coined. Before that, he initiated and led
the [Java Commodity Grid Kit](http://www.cogkit.org) which provided
the basis for hundreds of Grid-related projects, including the Globus
Toolkit.
