You may like some of the quotes from students: 

> "Best class I ever took at IU."

> "Thanks to you I got a job at a top rated company."

> "My company has adopted lessons learned from your class."

> "The level of support and expertise the professor provides is outstanding and unmatched within IU."

All classes can be taken by graduate and undergraduate students.
Undergraduate students may need permission from me for some classes. In
the past we had dedicated undergraduates participatintg in the class
that were in the top 5% of the class.

## Independent Study

Independent Studies are any time available for graduate and
undergraduate students.  Contact Gregor at <laszewski@gmail.com>.
Independent studies will work on programming projects, advanced cloud
topics, or conference/workshop papers.

## Undergraduate REU

This is a unique paid opportunity. It is available for US Citizens or
Permanent Residents. Strong knowledge in Linux and Python is required.
20 hour per week commitment is required. Please inqure with Gregor to
see if you are qualified.

## ENGR-E516 and CSCI-B649

The E516 class will be taught starting in Fall 2020 by a diferent
faculty member. Anyone with an incomplete is encouraged to find out if
they can complete the class with the new faculty.

Those that want to take a similar class, can do this as part of
tacking an independent study with me. 

The past classes relate to the following topics.

**Keywords:** AI cloud services, cloud workflows, multi-clouds,
map/reduce, build your own cloud cluster at our Lab, AWS, Azure,
Google, academic clouds, Kubernetes, Docker

**Information:** There is little prerequisite for this class other than
knowing a programming language. However, we had dedicated students with no
programming background that got an A+ in class. Links to registrar:

Both classes are the same. They are just listed in different
departments. These classes can be taken by anyone at the university. The
weekly agenda is posted at:

* [Lecture Notes](https://laszewski.github.io/book/e516/)

But it can as an independent study very flexibly modified to topics
you like to learn about. Online students will have the opportunity to attend a weekly online
meeting. The time for that will be determined based on a poll posted in the class
piazza.

**Note:** Students taking this class have access to our Lab space in the
building I am in if you like to use it (optional). I have 8 office
spaces, so you could have your own office space if you like. You
however can do your work anywhere. Free transportation is provided.
After hour access to the building can be arranged.

**Undergraduates:** Advanced undergraduates with Python knowledge are
allowed to take the class with permission from Gregor and the
department. Please contact me via e-mail if you like to take the class
and are qualified. The space for undergraduates is limited.
