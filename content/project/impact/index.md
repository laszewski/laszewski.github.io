In scientific impact metrics we attempt to evaluate the work conducted
by researcher teams or organizations and compare how they perform to
other groups.

In our effort we use the bibliometrics approach to evaluate the
scientific impact of XSEDE. By utilizing publication data from various
sources, e.g., ISI Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph, we
calculate the impact metrics of XSEDE publications and show how they
compare with non-XSEDE publication from the same field of study, or
non-organization peers from the same journal issue. To perform this
analysis we need to identify the bibliographic dataset and clean and
currate them.

We then introduce the metrics we used for evaluation and comparison, and
the methods used to calculate them. Detailed analysis results of Field
Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and the peers comparison will be
presented and discussed. We also explain how the same approaches could
be used to evaluate publications from a similar organization or
institute, to demonstrate the general applicability of the present
evaluation approach providing impact on organizations and groups.
