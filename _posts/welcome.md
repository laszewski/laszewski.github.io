My previous Webpage was created using hugo.

Although I like hugo, docsy and hugo-academic quite a lot. However, I
found that the management of BibTex is too combersome. I overcame this
by writing my own scripts to eliminate thes flowas. Nevertheless,
every youuer I run into the issue that my compile freme work no longer
works. I think this could be solved using docker by freezing the
version.

As it is currently however not working, I decided to address both
issues by switching to jekyll. I hope that I will not regret that
choice as converting my web page is quite a bit of effort.

I am using jekyll-scholar and the theme minimal. I have modified
severl aspects of it to deal with projects, bibliography and the
frontpage a bit better.

It could benefit from improvements, but I have decided to keep it so
far simple as I did not want to spend too much time on the
development.
