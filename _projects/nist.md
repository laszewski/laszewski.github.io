Reference architectures provide *an authoritative source of information
about a specific subject area that guides and constrains the
instantiations of multiple architectures and solutions*. Reference
architectures generally serve as a foundation for solution architectures
and may also be used for comparison and alignment of instantiations of
architectures and solutions. The goal of the NBD-PWG Reference
Architecture Subgroup is to develop an open reference architecture for
Big Data that achieves the following objectives:

* Provides a common language for the various stakeholders;
* Encourages adherence to common standards, specifications, and patterns;
* Provides consistent methods for implementation of technology to solve 
  similar problem sets;
* Illustrates and improves understanding of the various Big Data 
  components, processes, and systems, in the context of a vendor- and 
  technology-agnostic Big Data conceptual model;
* Provides a technical reference for U.S. government departments, 
  agencies, and other consumers to understand, discuss, categorize, and 
  compare Big Data solutions; and 
* Facilitates analysis of candidate standards for interoperability, 
  portability, reusability, and extendibility.
