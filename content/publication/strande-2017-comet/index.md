abstract: The Comet petascale supercomputer was put into production as an XSEDE resource
  in early 2015 with the goal of serving a much larger user community than HPC systems
  of similar size. The Comet project set an audacious goal of reaching over 10,000
  users in its four years of planned operation. That goal was achieved in less than
  two years, due in large part to the adoption of policies that favor smaller allocations
  and science gateways. Here we describe our experiences in operating and supporting
  Comet, highlight some of the important science that it has enabled, and provide
  some practical lessons that we have learned by operating a system designed for the
  long tail of science.
