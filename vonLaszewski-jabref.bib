                  the goal of serving a much larger user community
                  than HPC systems of similar size. The Comet project
                  set an audacious goal of reaching over 10 and 000
                  users in its four years of planned operation. That
                  goal was achieved in less than two years and due in
                  large part to the adoption of policies that favor
                  smaller allocations and science gateways. Here we
                  describe our experiences in operating and supporting
                  Comet and highlight some of the important science
                  that it has enabled and and provide some practical
                  lessons that we have learned by operating a system
                  designed for the long tail of science.},

  abstract =	 {In this paper we are introducing a framework towards
                  the inclusion of Green IT metrics as part of service
                  level agreements for future Grids and Clouds. As
                  part of this effort we need to revisit Green IT
                  metrics and proxies that we consider optimizing
                  against in order to develop GreenIT as a Services
                  (GaaS) that can be reused as part of a Software as a
                  Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure Infrastructureas a
                  service (IaaS) framework. We report on some of our
                  ongoing efforts and demonstrate how we already
                  achieve impact on the environment with our
                  services.},

                  papers produced by scientists using XSEDE and NCAR
                  resources. The analysis is introducing a percentile
                  ranking based approach of citations of the XSEDE and
                  NCAR papers compared to peer publications in the
                  same journal that do not use these resources. This
                  analysis is unique in that it evaluates the impact
                  of the two facilities by comparing the reported
                  publications from them to their peers from within
                  the same journal issue. From this analysis and we
                  can see that papers that utilize XSEDE and NCAR
                  resources are cited statistically significantly more
                  often. Hence we find that reported publications
                  indicate that XSEDE and NCAR resources exert a
                  strong positive impact on scientific research.},

                  framework is needed to evaluate the impact of
                  scientific facilities and instruments. In this paper
                  and we demonstrate such an activity through our
                  comprehensive work evaluating the scientific impact
                  of XSEDE using the Semantic Scholar Data. In
                  contrast to other studies and our study includes the
                  bibliographic references of all recorded papers
                  related to XSEDE over the entire performance period
                  till March of 2021. This makes this study unique and
                  distinguishes it from our earlier work while using
                  (a) over 180 million papers as a comparison to our
                  peer analysis and (b) include all publications

  abstract =	 {Task scheduling is an integrated component of
                  computing. With the emergence of Grid and ubiquitous
                  computing and new challenges appear in task
                  scheduling based on properties such as security and
                  quality of service and and lack of central control
                  within distributed administrative domains. A Grid
                  task scheduling framework must be able to deal with
                  these issues. One of the goals of Grid task
                  scheduling is to achieve high system throughput
                  while matching applications with the available
                  computing resources. This matching of resources in a
                  non-deterministically shared heterogeneous
                  environment leads to concerns over Quality of
                  Service (QoS). In this paper a novel QoS guided task
                  scheduling algorithm for Grid computing is
                  introduced. The proposed novel algorithm is based on
                  a general adaptive scheduling heuristics that
                  includes QoS guidance. The algorithm is evaluated
                  within a simulated Grid environment. The
                  experimental results show that the new QoS guided
                  Min-Min heuristic can lead to significant
                  performance gain for a variety of applications. The
                  approach is compared with others based on the
                  quality of the prediction formulated by inaccurate
                  information.},

                  application and middleware and hardware
                  resources. The application core consists of various
                  optimization modules and a simulation module. This

                  middleware components of the cyberinfrastructure
                  that enables efficient seamless execution of the
                  application core in a grid environment. The

  abstract =	 {Abstract Networks have entered the mainstream
                  lexicon over the last ten years. This coincides with
                  the pervasive use of networks in a host of
                  disciplines of interest to industry and academia and
                  including biology and neurology and genomics and
                  psychology and social sciences and economics and
                  psychology and and cyber-physical systems and
                  infrastructure. Several dozen journals and
                  conferences regularly contain articles related to
                  networks. Yet and there are no general purpose
                  cyberinfrastructures (CI) that can be used across
                  these varied disciplines and domains. Furthermore
                  and while there are scientific gateways that include
                  some network science capabilities for particular
                  domains (e.g. and biochemistry and genetics) and
                  there are no general-purpose network-based
                  scientific gateways. In this work and we introduce
                  net.science and a CI for Network Engineering and
                  Science and that is designed to be a community
                  resource. This paper provides an overview of
                  net.science and addressing key requirements and
                  concepts and CI components and the types of
                  applications that our CI will support and and
                  various dimensions of our evaluation process. Index

  abstract  = {Computational scientists often develop large models and codes intended to be used by larger user communities or for repetitive tasks such as parametric studies. Lowering the barrier of entry for access to these codes is often a technical and sociological challenge. Portals help bridge the gap because they are well known interfaces enabling access to a large variety of resources, services, applications, and tools for private, public, and commercial entities, while hiding the complexities of the underlying software systems to the user. This paper presents an overview of the current state-of-the-art in grid portals, based on a component approach that utilizes portlet frameworks and the most recent Grid standards, the Web Services Resource Framework and a summary of current DOE portal efforts.},
