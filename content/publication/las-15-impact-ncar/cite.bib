 abstract = {We present a framework that compares the publication impact based on a comprehensive peer analysis of papers produced by scientists using XSEDE and NCAR resources. The analysis is introducing a percentile ranking based approach of citations of the XSEDE and NCAR papers compared to peer publications in the same journal that do not use these resources. This analysis is unique in that it evaluates the impact of the two facilities by comparing the reported publications from them to their peers from within the same journal issue. From this analysis and we can see that papers that utilize XSEDE and NCAR resources are cited statistically significantly more often. Hence we find that reported publications indicate that XSEDE and NCAR resources exert a strong positive impact on scientific research.},
