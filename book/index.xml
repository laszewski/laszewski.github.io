      <description>Python is an easy to learn programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s simple syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
This online book will provide you with enough information so that you can conduct your programming for the cloud in python.</description>

      <description>An important part of any scientific research is to communicate and document it. Previously we used LaTeX in this class to provide the ability to contribute professional looking documents. As part of this we also noticed that any document from any student that ever submitted a document in MSWord was inferior to those using structured documents such as provided by LaTeX or markdown. Although we would have loved to continue our work in LaTeX, a small number of students made the full adaptation of LaTeX as document system not possible.</description>
