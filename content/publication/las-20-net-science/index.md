abstract: 'Abstract Networks have entered the mainstream lexicon over the last ten
  years. This coincides with the pervasive use of networks in a host of disciplines
  of interest to industry and academia and including biology and neurology and genomics
  and psychology and social sciences and economics and psychology and and cyber-physical
  systems and infrastructure. Several dozen journals and conferences regularly contain
  articles related to networks. Yet and there are no general purpose cyberinfrastructures
  (CI) that can be used across these varied disciplines and domains. Furthermore and
  while there are scientific gateways that include some network science capabilities
  for particular domains (e.g. and biochemistry and genetics) and there are no general-purpose
  network-based scientific gateways. In this work and we introduce net.science and
  a CI for Network Engineering and Science and that is designed to be a community
  resource. This paper provides an overview of net.science and addressing key requirements
  and concepts and CI components and the types of applications that our CI will support
  and and various dimensions of our evaluation process. Index Terms: cyberinfrastructure
  and network science and net.science'
