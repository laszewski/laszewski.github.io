Driven by the big data revolution and artificial intelligence, these frameworks are now ever more important in order to process terabytes of data. They can easily exceed the capabilities of a single machine but also demand significant developer time and effort due to their convenience and ability to manipulate data with high-level abstractions that can be optimized. Therefore it is essential to design scalable dataframe solutions. There have been multiple efforts to be integrated into the most efficient fashion to tackle this problem, the most notable being the dataframe systems developed using distributed computing environments such as Dask and Ray. Even though Dask and Ray's distributed computing features look very promising, we perceive that the Dask Dataframes and Ray Datasets still have room for optimization In this paper, we present CylonFlow, an alternative distributed dataframe execution methodology that enables state-of-the-art performance and scalability on the same Dask and Ray infrastructure (supercharging them!). To achieve this, we integrate a high-performance dataframe system Cylon, which was originally based on an entirely different execution paradigm, into Dask and Ray. Our experiments show that on a pipeline of dataframe operators, CylonFlow achieves 30 times more distributed performance than Dask Dataframes. Interestingly, it also enables superior sequential performance due to leveraging the native C++ execution of Cylon. We believe the performance of Cylon in conjunction with CylonFlow extends beyond the data engineering domain and can be used to consolidate high-performance computing and distributed computing ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"Supercharging distributed computing environments for high-performance data engineering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Minutoli","Reece Neff","Naw Sattar","Hao Lu","John Feo","Henning Mortveit","Anil Vullikanti","Dawen Xie","Amanda Wilson","Gregor von Laszewski","Parantapa Bhattacharya","Ananth Kalyanaraman","Michela Becchi","Madhav Marathe","Mahantesh Halappanavar"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368190,"objectID":"50eb5c60a7211ad6cb4cbf50d56cd89a","permalink":"/publication/madhav-23-ripples/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:50.596124Z","relpermalink":"/publication/madhav-23-ripples/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Ripples: Exascale-Enabled Influence Maximization on Massive Social Networks with Implications to Pandemic Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.C.

Requirements In order for you to participate in this project, you will need:\nYou need to have financial resources to buy yourself the material for creating a PI cluster. You will need at least 3 Pis with 8GB memory. Each of them costs $75, but you also need a power supply costing $35, power cables, network cables, and at least one HDMI cable suitable to connect an HDMI monitor to a PI. More details about parts can be found at https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/docs/hardware/parts/ If you also have a Laptop or desktop to which you like to connect the PI, make sure it can run docker (Windows Home will not work). However, one of the Raspberry PIs will do. Significant Python knowledge Be highly motivated Be willing to have meetings on this project once or twice a week SHowcase significant progress over the lifetime of the project. be knowledgeable with GitHub (a repository will be provided to which Dr. von Laszewski will contribute) Conduct task management in GitHub (Gregor will explain) Be honest and not hiding problems or implementation bugs. You must be able to do a videoconference and be able to share your screen (I typically use google meet or zoom). Options We like you to explore the deployment both on RaspberryOS and on Ubuntu.\nPlease be aware that the goal is not to replicate tutorials from the Web that require input by hand or repeated installs on the various PIs. Instead, we like to have a single command such as\ncms pi cluster deploy kubernetes --hosts \u0026quot;red,red[01-red02]\u0026quot;\nwhere simple options such as the hostnames in the pi cluster are used.\nGetting started In the first week, collect a list of all projects on the internet that do something similar Study the GitHub repositories from cloudmesh-pi-burn and cloudmesh-pi-cluster and cloudmesh-common intensely. Explore the old code and identify what is wrong with it (just by looking at it) Identify a base method. This can use existing DevOps approaches such as ansible, cheff, snapcraft (ubuntu), or cloudmesh parallel runtime methods. However, the use will be hidden through an API and command line tool. Evaluate the llnl simple deployment method which can be used. Also exploer if there is a snap available. From the command line, derive some API interface and use FastAPI to implement it. Identify a mechanism on how to deal with the security. Before you start implementing, describe and showcase a couple of commands on how to use it.

Provide a mechanism to verify if the deployment was successful Provide a set of unit tests using pytest to execute some basic use cases. Develop a python API that supports the deployment while exposing it through a command line Explore the development of a REST API that facilitates the deployment reusing the developed Python API. Develop a manual Develop a high-quality report with benchmarks. Requirements In order for you to participate in this project, you will need:\nYou need to have financial resources to buy yourself the material for creating a PI cluster. You will need at least 3 Pis with 8GB memory. Each of them costs $75, but you also need a power supply costing $35, power cables, network cables, and at least one HDMI cable suitable to connect an HDMI monitor to a PI. More details about parts can be found at https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/docs/hardware/parts/ If you also have a Laptop or desktop to which you like to connect the PI, make sure it can run docker (Windows Home will not work). However, one of the Raspberry PIs will do. Significant python knowledge Be highly motivated Be willing to have meetings on this project once or twice a week SHowcase significant progress over the lifetime of the project. be knowledgeable with GitHub (a repository will be provided to which Dr. von Laszewski will contribute) Conduct task management in GitHub (Gregor will explain) Be honest and not hiding problems or implementation bugs. You must be able to do a videoconference and be able to share your screen (I typically use google meet or zoom). Options There is a great overlap between installing Hadoop and Spark on a cluster. We recommend that the team slits up the work but collaborates intensely to create a uniform solution.\nPlease be aware that the goal is not to replicate tutorials from the Web that require input by hand or repeated installs on the various PIs. Instead, we like to have a single command such as\ncms pi cluster deploy spark --hosts \u0026quot;red,red[01-red02]\u0026quot;\nwhere simple options such as the hostnames in the pi cluster are used.\nGetting started In the first week, collect a list of all projects on the internet that do something similar Study the GitHub repositories from cloudmesh-pi-burn and cloudmesh-pi-cluster and cloudmesh-common intensely. Explore the old code and identify what is wrong with it (just by looking at it) Identify a new deployment method. This can use existing DevOps approaches such as ansible, cheff, snapcraft (ubuntu), or cloudmesh parallel runtime methods. However, the use will be hidden through an API and command line tool. From the command line, derive some API interface and use FastAPI to implement it. Identify a mechanism on how to deal with the security. Before you start implementing, describe and showcase a couple of commands on how to use it. Your deployment should target Ubuntu on the PI as well as RaspberryOS. If there is only time for one, pick one. Note that Hadoop or Spark may also be able to be installed on the PIs with snapcraft. Discuss how this solution could be used for the implementation of this project.

You must be able to do a videoconference and be able to share your screen (I typically use google meet or zoom). Options One of the two projects used a single file taansfer logic, while the other used a parallel file transfer option. It will be up to you to decide how to proceed.\nGetting started In the first week collect all clouds and services that could be used in this project. THis work should be split between the teammembers and a detailed analysis including features including authentication and security must be conducted.\nYou will need to evaluate the previous efforts and decide how to proceed.\nOne way is to select several cloudas and define an abstraction that has to be implemented for each cloud. this can be actually bes demonstrated by an example commandline such as\nvdir mkdir DIR vdir cd [DIR] vdir ls [DIR] vdir add [FILEENDPOINT] [DIR_AND_NAME] vdir delete [DIR_OR_NAME] vdir status [DIR_OR_NAME] vdir get NAME DESTINATION From the commandline derive some API interface and use FastAPI to implement it.\nIdentify a mechnism on how to deal with the security. AN encrypted file with your cloud credentials will be sufficient.\nOne of the limitations of the previous vdir project is that the fill add function is done only on a single file but not on a recursive file tree. Naturally we need to upload, single files, multiple files and filetrees, similar to the unix command rsync. This has been implemented in the storage command\nstorage [--storage=SERVICE] [--parallel=N] create dir DIRECTORY storage [--storage=SERVICE] [--parallel=N] get SOURCE DESTINATION [--recursive] storage [--storage=SERVICE] [--parallel=N] put SOURCE DESTINATION [--recursive] storage [--storage=SERVICE] [--parallel=N] list [SOURCE] [--recursive] [--output=OUTPUT] storage [--storage=SERVICE] [--parallel=N] delete SOURCE storage [--storage=SERVICE] search DIRECTORY FILENAME [--recursive] [--output=OUTPUT] storage [--storage=SERVICE] sync SOURCE DESTINATION [--name=NAME] [--async] storage [--storage=SERVICE] sync status [--name=NAME] storage config list [--output=OUTPUT] storage [--parallel=N] copy SOURCE DESTINATION [--recursive] We like naturally to (re-)implement the storage command.\nBefore you start implementing describe and showcase a couple of commands on how to used it. Our command will be called cdir (for cloudmesh dir so it is easy to distinguish)\nMake sure that you provide a comprehensive list of potentail cloud storage ervices. Distinguish between for pay and free services.\nThe list could include:\nAWS Drive AWS Object Store An ssh accesible computer Azure Box Degoo Dropbox Google Drive Google docs/drive Icedrive MEGA MediaFire MediaFire Mega Nextcloud OneCloud OneDrive Oracle Sync.com WebDAV Your local computer iCloud iDrive idrive pCloud Are there companies or services that already offer this?\nWhen defining the REST API we like to be able to use a dirname and a basename within the api similar to python. to deal with provider specific filenames we do have two urls for a file.\n{provider}/{dirname}/{basename} {dirname}/{basename}\nThe first allows duplication of files between services, the latter defines a \u0026ldquo;preferred\u0026rdquo; url based on some criteria. It could be that we just set the preferred provider for the file.\nNote that the introduction of duplicating files is new\nIt also requires an update so that the file with the newest timestamp gets updated on all registered serrvices.\nPlease note that the project addresses the ability to integrate object store and regular file system based storage.\nNot all implementation must be done on Ubuntu20.04 which is run via a container. The graphical component is done wia moder Web view technologies. Wile all other implementation can be done in python, the GUI can also be implemented in JavaScript. The service accessing other services must be properly protected which is easy as we assum it runs on localhost and we can appropriately secure it with common solutions.\nIn case of qeuestions, pleas econtact Gregor at\nlaszewski@gmail.com\n","date":1627799582,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627799582,"objectID":"a116e48cfb60230f22b13d3bf2e80da0","permalink":"/post/project-vdir/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T01:33:02-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/project-vdir/","section":"post","summary":"Virtual directory Be part of a team to create a multicloud virtual directory.\nYour goal will be to to develop an API, secure REST, and commandline tool that easily interfaces with storage servoces such as file based services and object stores osted on the internet to create a virtual directory that accesses the files by directory name and filename.","tags":["contribute","project","cloud","class"],"title":"Multi Cloud Virtual Directory","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["class"],"content":"Be part of a team to create a multicloud access to a service offered by multiple cloud or cloud service providers.\nYour goal will be to develop an API, secure REST, and command line tool that easily interfaces with a service framework or tool offered by multiple cloud providers.

This could be another PI or a PI Zero with WiFi. You have two options here. A use the Pi Zero and hook it up to a battery so you can move the PI to record an attached sensor such as temperature, humidity, pressure and record the values for it when moving around. Another thing would be to measure the strength of the WiFi network and other networks you may discover.

In this project you would be building a cluster and than putting cloud software on the cluster to make it our own cloud service.\nSuch software can include but is not limited to\nDocker Kubernetwes Map/Reduce When chosing this project one must address the issue of dealing with many compute resources at a time. THis can be done with PXE boot or with our cm-burn.\nStudents that chose this project will have an office space in the building that I sit. In addition each student will be given a 5 node cluster thay can work at home on (non smoking environment) that must be returned after the project is completed.\ncm-burn cm-burn is a program to burn many SD cards for the preparation of building clusters with Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s. The program is developed in Python and is portable on Linux, Windows, and OSX. It allows users to create readily bootable SD cards that have the network configured, contain a public ssh key from your machine that you used to configure the cards. The unique feature is that you can burn multiple cards in a row.\nA sample command invocation looks like:\ncm-burn â€”-name red[5-7] \\ --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \\ â€”-ips 192.168.1.[5-7] \\ â€”-image 2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch This command creates 3 SD cards where the hostnames red5, red6, red 7 with the network addresses 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, and 192.168.1.7. The public key is added to the authorized_keys file of the pi user. The password login is automatically disabled and only the ssh key authentication is enabled.\nReferences https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm-burn ","date":1565827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565827200,"objectID":"2762d9c5c5bcbb796aed5fa88b61de6c","permalink":"/project/pi-cloud-cluster/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pi-cloud-cluster/","section":"project","summary":"Raspberry Pi Cloud Cluster THis project is open to anyone wanting to work with me on building a Raspberry Pi Cloud Cluster.

By utilizing publication data from various sources, e.g., ISI Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph, we calculate the impact metrics of XSEDE publications and show how they compare with non-XSEDE publication from the same field of study, or non-organization peers from the same journal issue. To perform this analysis we need to identify the bibliographic dataset and clean and currate them.\nWe then introduce the metrics we used for evaluation and comparison, and the methods used to calculate them. Detailed analysis results of Field Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and the peers comparison will be presented and discussed. We also explain how the same approaches could be used to evaluate publications from a similar organization or institute, to demonstrate the general applicability of the present evaluation approach providing impact on organizations and groups.\nReferences Evaluating the Scientific Impact of XSEDE Fugang Wang, Gregor von Laszewski, Timothy Whitson, Geoffrey C Fox, Thomas R Furlani, Robert L DeLeon, Steven M Gallo Jan 1, 2018\nPeer Comparison of XSEDE and NCAR Publication Data G. von Laszewski, F.

Lowering the barrier of entry for access to these codes is often a technical and sociological challenge. Portals help bridge the gap because they are well known interfaces enabling access to a large variety of resources, services, applications, and tools for private, public, and commercial entities, while hiding the complexities of the underlying software systems to the user. This paper presents an overview of the current state-of-the-art in grid portals, based on a component approach that utilizes portlet frameworks and the most recent Grid standards, the Web Services Resource Framework and a summary of current DOE portal efforts.","tags":[],"title":"Grid portal architectures for scientific applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

In order to achieve a valid climate forecast, an accurate initial condition is needed to apply the governing equations describing the model. Data analysis techniques are able to derive this initial state from irregular distributed observations. This thesis provides a parallel algorithm for the data analysis. Algorithms using static and dynamic decomposition are introduced and their performance is analyzed. A decomposition with linear speedup is presented.During the parallelization many different computers and programming paradigms have been utilized. In order to simplify the access for the user and developer a metacomputing environment has been developed. The meta-computing environment allows one to generate message passing parallel programs from a visual representation of a task graph. Besides the creation of stand-alone parallel programs, the task graph can be transferred into separate jobs executed on different supercomputers. Messages between the jobs are exchanged with the help of files. The underlying concept for this metacomputing environment is a dynamical dataflow model allowing multi-paradigm programming. A dynamical task scheduling algorithm determines on which component of the metacomputer a task is scheduled and which algorithm performs the task. The execution of the program is visually animated.","tags":[],"title":"A Parallel Data Assimilation System and Its Implications on a Metacomputing Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":788918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368174,"objectID":"2bb965f1d393227f09069a93c05c203f","permalink":"/publication/las-1995-issues-parallel/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:34.608236Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-1995-issues-parallel/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Issues in Parallel Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":788918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368174,"objectID":"8849aaf625fa98bd19bc567be975c638","permalink":"/publication/las-1995-infomall/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:34.547749Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-1995-infomall/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Minimal Requirements for a Graphical User Interface for InfoMall Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":788918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368174,"objectID":"497a7652fd66a7bc89592c8b0733bdb5","permalink":"/publication/las-1995-mopac/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:34.672916Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-1995-mopac/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Parallelization of MOPAC","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":788918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368174,"objectID":"1d4f57669159f5132bffd0332b9c7835","permalink":"/publication/las-1995-xpvm/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:34.73526Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-1995-xpvm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"XPVM: An X window based interface to the PVM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski","Mike Seablom","Milo Makivic","Peter Lyster","Sanya Ranka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":783648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368174,"objectID":"6b8b3710033158befc64ef18884297db","permalink":"/publication/las-1994-ecwmf/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:34.486768Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-1994-ecwmf/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Design Issues for the Parallelization of an Optimal Interpolation Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":725846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368174,"objectID":"c687bb016a584a44d83fddcdade294d2","permalink":"/publication/las-1993-collection/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:34.299783Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-1993-collection/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A collection of graph partitioning algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":[" Mohamed","A Gaber","Geoffrey C Fox","Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":725846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368174,"objectID":"17bab991371b77a147e587970b85f1f6","permalink":"/publication/las-1993-lu-journal/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:34.362023Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-1993-lu-journal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Blocked LU factorization on a multiprocessor computer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor von Laszewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":725846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724368174,"objectID":"e48c6b671a61e7356cd290cf813269a6","permalink":"/publication/las-1993-parallelization/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T23:09:34.422033Z","relpermalink":"/publication/las-1993-parallelization/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Parallelization of a Weather Prediction Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.
