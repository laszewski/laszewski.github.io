abstract: 'This paper describes a preliminary cyberinfrastructure for contaminant
  characterization in water distribution systems and its deployment on the grid. The
  cyberinfrastructure consists of the application and middleware and hardware resources.
  The application core consists of various optimization modules and a simulation module.
  This paper focuses on the development of specific middleware components of the cyberinfrastructure
  that enables efficient seamless execution of the application core in a grid environment.
  The components developed in this research include: (i) a coarse-grained parallel
  wrapper for the simulation module that includes additional features for persistent
  execution and (ii) a seamless job submission interface and and (iii) a graphical
  real time application monitoring tool. The performance of the cyberinfrastructure
  is evaluated on a local cluster and the TeraGrid.'
