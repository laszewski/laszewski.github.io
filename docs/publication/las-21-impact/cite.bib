 abstract = {The United States science and engineering community faces multiple challenges related to funding and funding policies for science and engineering. A framework is needed to evaluate the impact of scientific facilities and instruments. In this paper and we demonstrate such an activity through our comprehensive work evaluating the scientific impact of XSEDE using the Semantic Scholar Data. In contrast to other studies and our study includes the bibliographic references of all recorded papers related to XSEDE over the entire performance period till March of 2021. This makes this study unique and distinguishes it from our earlier work while using (a) over 180 million papers as a comparison to our peer analysis and (b) include all publications reported and and (c) conduct the study repeatedly over several years.},
