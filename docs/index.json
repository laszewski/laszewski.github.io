In this project you would be building a cluster and than putting cloud software on the cluster to make it our own cloud service.\nSuch software can include but is not limited to\n Docker Kubernetwes Map/Reduce  When chosing this project one must address the issue of dealing with many compute resources at a time. THis can be done with PXE boot or with our cm-burn.\nStudents that chose this project will have an office space in the building that I sit. In addition each student will be given a 5 node cluster thay can work at home on (non smoking environment) that must be returned after the project is completed.\ncm-burn cm-burn is a program to burn many SD cards for the preparation of building clusters with Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s. The program is developed in Python and is portable on Linux, Windows, and OSX. It allows users to create readily bootable SD cards that have the network configured, contain a public ssh key from your machine that you used to configure the cards. The unique feature is that you can burn multiple cards in a row.\nA sample command invocation looks like:\ncm-burn —-name red[5-7] \\ --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \\ —-ips 192.168.1.[5-7] \\ —-image 2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch  This command creates 3 SD cards where the hostnames red5, red6, red 7 with the network addresses 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, and 192.168.1.7. The public key is added to the authorized_keys file of the pi user. The password login is automatically disabled and only the ssh key authentication is enabled.\nReferences  https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm-burn  ","date":1565841600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565841600,"objectID":"2762d9c5c5bcbb796aed5fa88b61de6c","permalink":"/project/pi-cloud-cluster/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/pi-cloud-cluster/","section":"project","summary":"Raspberry Pi Cloud Cluster THis project is open to anyone wanting to work with me on building a Raspberry Pi Cloud Cluster.

By utilizing publication data from various sources, e.g., ISI Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph, we calculate the impact metrics of XSEDE publications and show how they compare with non-XSEDE publication from the same field of study, or non-organization peers from the same journal issue. To perform this analysis we need to identify the bibliographic dataset and clean and currate them.\nWe then introduce the metrics we used for evaluation and comparison, and the methods used to calculate them. Detailed analysis results of Field Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and the peers comparison will be presented and discussed. We also explain how the same approaches could be used to evaluate publications from a similar organization or institute, to demonstrate the general applicability of the present evaluation approach providing impact on organizations and groups.\nReferences    Evaluating the Scientific Impact of XSEDE Fugang Wang, Gregor von Laszewski, Timothy Whitson, Geoffrey C Fox, Thomas R Furlani, Robert L DeLeon, Steven M Gallo Jan 1, 2018\n   Peer Comparison of XSEDE and NCAR Publication Data G. von Laszewski, F.
