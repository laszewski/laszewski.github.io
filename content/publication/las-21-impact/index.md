abstract: The United States science and engineering community faces multiple challenges
  related to funding and funding policies for science and engineering. A framework
  is needed to evaluate the impact of scientific facilities and instruments. In this
  paper and we demonstrate such an activity through our comprehensive work evaluating
  the scientific impact of XSEDE using the Semantic Scholar Data. In contrast to other
  studies and our study includes the bibliographic references of all recorded papers
  related to XSEDE over the entire performance period till March of 2021. This makes
  this study unique and distinguishes it from our earlier work while using (a) over
  180 million papers as a comparison to our peer analysis and (b) include all publications
  reported and and (c) conduct the study repeatedly over several years.
