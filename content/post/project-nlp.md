Be part of a team to create a multicloud natural language processing service.

Your goal will be to to develop an API, secure REST, and commandline
tool that easily interfaces with natural language services of multiple
cloud providers.  YOur integrated service will utilize all or one
ofthem to achive a task related to NLP analysis.

This is espacielly usefull for data scientists that may want to access
multiple cloud providers and eliminate vendor lockin or to access
services that other providers do not offer.

## Deliverables

You will be debelopping

1. A comparision of NLP cloud services.

   * Aylien	
   * Text Summarization	
   * Twinword Text Analysis 
   * IBM Watson Alchemy	
   * RxNLP	
   * Linguakit	
   * Geneea Interpretor NLP
   * MLP CLoud
   * Natural Language AI <https://cloud.google.com/natural-language>
   * CLoud Factory NLP <https://www.cloudfactory.com/services/nlp>
   * MonkeyLearn
   * MeaningCloud
   * Lexalytics
   * ...
   * There could be many more

   Distinguish them nby chracteroistics, create a table
   
1. A commandline interface to the service
2. A Rest API that calls out other services
3. A Python API that wraps several services into a convenient library
5. A manual describing the functionality


4. Put everything in a container so it can be run on Linux, MAc and
   Windows.
5. Create a convenient commandline tool that allows starting of the
   service, interacting with it and make this real easy to use. THe
   commandline will hide the docker commands while providing human
   readable abbreviations.
6. Deliver unit tests with pytests
6. Deliver a high quality report including benchmarks
7. Integrate authentication to the cloud providers and to the REST service.
8. Use Yaml for the configuration of the service
9. Do the development in a container using 20.04. We will create a DOckerfile
10. The code will be developed in github at cloudmesh-nlp which will be setup by Gregor


## Requirements

In order for you to participate in this project you will need:

1. A computer on which you can run docker (Windows Home will not work)
2. Significant python knowledge
3. Be highly motivated
4. Be willing to have meetings on this project once or twice a week
5. Showcase significant progress over the lifetime of the project.
6. Be knowledgable with github (a repository will be provided to which
   Dr. von Laszewski will contribute)
7. Conduct task management in GitHub (Gregor will explain)
8. Be honest and not hiding problems or implementation bugs.
9. You must be able to do a videoconference and be able to share your screen (I typically use google meet or zoom).

## Getting started

1. start with a Survey
2. design the commanline interface first as that may be the easiest and will showcase how to design the API
