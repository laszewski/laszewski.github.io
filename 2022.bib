  ABSTRACT =	 {Digitization is changing our world, creating
                  innovative finance channels and emerging technology
                  such as cryptocurrencies, which are applications of
                  blockchain technology. However, cryptocurrency price
                  volatility is one of this technology&rsquo;s main
                  trade-offs. In this paper, we explore a time series
                  analysis using deep learning to study the volatility
                  and to understand this behavior. We apply a long
                  short-term memory model to learn the patterns within
                  cryptocurrency close prices and to predict future
                  prices. The proposed model learns from the close
                  values. The performance of this model is evaluated
                  using the root-mean-squared error and by comparing
                  it to an ARIMA model.},

                  landscape for conducting data analytics has
                  completely changed. While in the past, a lot of the
                  activities have been undertaken in isolation by
                  companies, and research institutions, today's
                  infrastructure constitutes a wealth of analytics
                  services offered by a variety of providers that
                  offer opportunities for reuse, interactions while
                  leveraging service collaboration, and service
                  cooperation. In this talk, we project our vision to
                  develop an analytics services framework to integrate
                  reusable hybrid multi-services across different
                  cloud infrastructure and service providers as well
                  as on-premise infrastructure and services. It
                  includes (a) analytics services that explicitly
                  target the intersection of hybrid multi-provider
                  analytics services, (b) the integration of sensor
                  networks into the service data, (c) the integration
                  of advanced modelling services as part of analytical
                  tasks such as earthquake prediction, and (d) the
                  coordination of these services. We showcase how our
                  vision can integrate leveraging service composition
                  with cooperation and competition analytics services.
                  We demonstrate the activities while utilizing
                  benchmark analytics services as used by the
                  MLCommons science benchmark working group.},
