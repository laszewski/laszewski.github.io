abstract: In this paper we are introducing a framework towards the inclusion of Green
  IT metrics as part of service level agreements for future Grids and Clouds. As part
  of this effort we need to revisit Green IT metrics and proxies that we consider
  optimizing against in order to develop GreenIT as a Services (GaaS) that can be
  reused as part of a Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure Infrastructureas
  a service (IaaS) framework. We report on some of our ongoing efforts and demonstrate
  how we already achieve impact on the environment with our services.
