                  against in order to develop GreenIT as a Services

                  Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure Infrastructureas a

                  (CMCS) is developing a powerful informatics-based
                  approach to synthesizing multi-scale information in
                  support of systems-based research and is applying it
                  within combustion science. An open source
                  multi-scale informatics toolkit is being developed
                  that addresses a number of issues core to the
                  emerging concept of knowledge grids including
                  provenance tracking and lightweight federation of
                  data and application resources into cross-scale
                  information flows. The CMCS portal is currently in
                  use by a number of high-profile pilot groups and is
                  playing a significant role in enabling their efforts
                  to improve and extend community maintained chemical
                  reference information.},

  abstract =	 {This thesis contributes to the area of data analysis
                  as used in atmospheric science and provides a
                  metacomputing environment for grand challenge
                  problems. In order to achieve a valid climate
                  forecast, an accurate initial condition is needed to
                  apply the governing equations describing the
                  model. Data analysis techniques are able to derive
                  this initial state from irregular distributed
                  observations. This thesis provides a parallel
                  algorithm for the data analysis. Algorithms using
                  static and dynamic decomposition are introduced and
                  their performance is analyzed. A decomposition with
                  linear speedup is presented.During the
                  parallelization many different computers and
                  programming paradigms have been utilized. In order
                  to simplify the access for the user and developer a
                  metacomputing environment has been developed. The
                  meta-computing environment allows one to generate
                  message passing parallel programs from a visual
                  representation of a task graph. Besides the creation
                  of stand-alone parallel programs, the task graph can
                  be transferred into separate jobs executed on
                  different supercomputers. Messages between the jobs
                  are exchanged with the help of files. The underlying
                  concept for this metacomputing environment is a
                  dynamical dataflow model allowing multi-paradigm
                  programming. A dynamical task scheduling algorithm
                  determines on which component of the metacomputer a
                  task is scheduled and which algorithm performs the
                  task. The execution of the program is visually
                  animated.},

  abstract =	 {Computational scientists often develop large models
                  and codes intended to be used by larger user
                  communities or for repetitive tasks such as
                  parametric studies. Lowering the barrier of entry
                  for access to these codes is often a technical and
                  sociological challenge. Portals help bridge the gap
                  because they are well known interfaces enabling
                  access to a large variety of resources, services,
                  applications, and tools for private, public, and
                  commercial entities, while hiding the complexities
                  of the underlying software systems to the user. This
                  paper presents an overview of the current
                  state-of-the-art in grid portals, based on a
                  component approach that utilizes portlet frameworks
                  and the most recent Grid standards, the Web Services
                  Resource Framework and a summary of current DOE
