abstract: Computational scientists often develop large models and codes intended to
  be used by larger user communities or for repetitive tasks such as parametric studies.
  Lowering the barrier of entry for access to these codes is often a technical and
  sociological challenge. Portals help bridge the gap because they are well known
  interfaces enabling access to a large variety of resources, services, applications,
  and tools for private, public, and commercial entities, while hiding the complexities
  of the underlying software systems to the user. This paper presents an overview
  of the current state-of-the-art in grid portals, based on a component approach that
  utilizes portlet frameworks and the most recent Grid standards, the Web Services
  Resource Framework and a summary of current DOE portal efforts.
