abstract: Digitization is changing our world, creating innovative finance channels
  and emerging technology such as cryptocurrencies, which are applications of blockchain
  technology. However, cryptocurrency price volatility is one of this technology&rsquo;s
  main trade-offs. In this paper, we explore a time series analysis using deep learning
  to study the volatility and to understand this behavior. We apply a long short-term
  memory model to learn the patterns within cryptocurrency close prices and to predict
  future prices. The proposed model learns from the close values. The performance
  of this model is evaluated using the root-mean-squared error and by comparing it
  to an ARIMA model.
