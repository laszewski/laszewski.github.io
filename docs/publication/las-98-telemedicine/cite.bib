 abstract = {Emerging telemedicine applications require the ability to exploit diverse and geographically distributed resources. Highspeed networks are used to integrate advanced visualization devices and sophisticated instruments and large databases and archival storage devices and PCs and workstations and and supercomputers. This form of telemedical environment is similar to networked virtual supercomputers and also known as metacomputers. Metacomputers are already being used in many scientific application areas. In this article and we analyze requirements necessary for a telemedical computing infrastructure and compare them with requirements found in a typical metacomputing environment. We will show that metacomputing environments can be used to enable a more powerful and unified computational infrastructure for telemedicine. The Globus metacomputing toolkit can provide the necessary low level mechanisms to enable a large scale telemedical infrastructure. The Globus toolkit
components are designed in a modular fashion and can be extended to support the specific requirements for telemedicine.},
