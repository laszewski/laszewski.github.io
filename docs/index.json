The analysis is introducing a percentile ranking based approach of citations of the XSEDE and NCAR papers compared to peer publications in the same journal that do not use these resources. This analysis is unique in that it evaluates the impact of the two facilities by comparing the reported publications from them to their peers from within the same journal issue. From this analysis, we can see that papers that utilize XSEDE and NCAR resources are cited statistically significantly more often. Hence we find that reported publications indicate that XSEDE and NCAR resources exert a strong positive impact on scientific research.","tags":["\"Resource management\"","\"Data analysis\"","\"Ranking (statistics)\"","\"Atmospheric measurements\"","\"Extraterrestrial measurements\"","\"Conferences\"","\"Metrics\"","\"publications\""],"title":"Peer Comparison of XSEDE and NCAR Publication Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geoffrey C.

The Comet project set an audacious goal of reaching over 10,000 users in its four years of planned operation. That goal was achieved in less than two years, due in large part to the adoption of policies that favor smaller allocations and science gateways. Here we describe our experiences in operating and supporting Comet, highlight some of the important science that it has enabled, and provide some practical lessons that we have learned by operating a system designed for the long tail of science.","tags":["\"high throughput computing\"","\"High performance computing\"","\"science gateways\"","\"solid-state drive\"","\"parallel file system\"","\"scientific applications\"","\"virtualization\"","\"user support\"","\"GPU\""],"title":"Comet: Tales from the Long Tail: Two Years In and 10,000 Users Later","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geoffrey C Fox","Gregor von Laszewski","Javier Diaz","Kate Keahey","Jose Fortes","Renato Figueiredo","Shava Smallen","Warren Smith","Andrew Grimshaw"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621007089,"objectID":"baa26fa1661b8ac657938cb12d384914","permalink":"/publication/fox-2017-futuregrid/","publishdate":"2021-05-14T15:44:49.128603Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fox-2017-futuregrid/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Futuregrid: a Reconfigurable Testbed for Cloud, Hpc, and Grid Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gergor von Laszewski","Geoffrey C.
